    - V.0.1.8 Version: Fixed Error messaging, added character checker, and guess what first function ever!!! it is called printcal([]); (dont mind the '[]' it just refer to the operation like '1+1') if user want to use the function don't add any strings or quote inside function if you still say "how do print/output any text?" dev is working on that to! so stay tuned and btw theres no more documentary code for now because everytime i update a repo the code inside my code editor have hundreds of lines of code so more screenshot more storage used and added a error handler if you want to do operation pls make sure you use the function printcal([]); if not it will show error said: "Error: No printcal([]) function was called! : (your code)". still thinking about adding variables but idk how to make it maybe some tutorial will help at least?. Dev will update a new version sooner or later.
